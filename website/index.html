                        environments for different stages of development. The Kubernetes clusters provided scalability
                        and
                        resilience, while the CI/CD pipelines facilitated rapid and reliable deployments. This approach
                        enabled the startup to focus on its core business and be confident in the stability and
                        efficiency
                        of its underlying infrastructure. The project highlighted my ability to deliver robust,
                        scalable,
                        and automated solutions in cloud environments, which is critical for supporting a dynamic
                        marketplace's rapid growth and demands.</p>

                    <p class="description">A SaaS for insurance companies needed expertise and advice on cloud best
                        practices. I was the primary
                        engineer assigned to the client, having to review their stack and services. I designed and
                        delivered
                        a well-architected landing zone based on the fundamental pillars of the framework, such as
                        security,
                        reliability, and operational excellence. The ecosystem relied on serverless applications and EC2
                        static workers. A part of the process consisted of providing continuous integration and delivery
                        to
                        improve the cadence of the development process and ease the operational overhead. Containerizing
                        vital business logic components were key to improving the QA and testing phases and providing
                        high
                        availability and fault tolerance capabilities in key components. Designing a SOC2-compliant
                        infrastructure was an essential piece of the project.</p>

                    <p class="description">I assisted a US-based fintech company in migrating from on-premises data
                        centers to AWS. After
                        assessing their stack and needs, I designed a highly available landing zone in AWS using the
                        Well-Architected Framework. The infrastructure was entirely managed with Infrastructure as Code,
                        and
                        the application was re-engineered and re-platformed to run on Kubernetes. All deployments were
                        automated through CI/CD pipelines. Additionally, I was tasked with cost reduction and
                        successfully
                        reduced AWS bills by up to 60% by leveraging Spot Instances and ARM64-based worker nodes on our
                        Kubernetes clusters. This approach optimized resource utilization and significantly cut
                        operational
                        costs, demonstrating my ability to deliver efficient and cost-effective solutions in cloud
                        environments. Overall, the project involved a complete transformation of the client's
                        infrastructure, enabling scalable, resilient, and cost-effective operations in the cloud while
                        maintaining high performance and availability.</p>
